## The Pitch
Have you ever rolled some dice and were amazed by the result? Maybe you wanted to share it with all your friends? Or maybe you were interested in the chance of rolling 17 on 3d6? The Dice Roller allows you to create an account where you can save sets of dice (3d6, 4d12, 10d10, 3d4+1d12, whatever you want). With these dice sets, you can roll them, getting an instant result (which you can share with your friends and show how (un)lucky you were), or you can look at the statistics of the dice set, and you can see just how lucky you were to get that high number. Once you're done with your own dice sets, you can look at what other people have rolled and the statistics that go along with their dice sets.
